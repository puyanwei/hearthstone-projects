# hearthstone-projects

Some replication of hearthstone functionality I want to try out using Vue Cli version 3.

- opening packs simulator
- arena drafting
- evolve simulator
- eventually the game itself with working board and trading minions

## Installation

```
npm install
npm run serve
```

## Tech

- Vue.js Cli version 3
- SCSS pre-processor built in
- Vue routing
- ES6 Javascript, HTML, CSS and all that jazz
