Practicing creating webpage layouts by copying designs using Nuxt.js

The priority is to improve creating webpage layouts using CSS grid. I want to make sure pages are responsive to screen sizes and try and achieve what I want with the minimal amount of CSS needed.

Good coding practices as always, and readability is a priority!

I'll list out the new pages I have created, they will be routed to their name so it should be localhost:3000/[name]

## Build Setup

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
